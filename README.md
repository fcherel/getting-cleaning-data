The run_analysis.R script supposes you downloaded and extracted the raw data in your working directory, so that you have a directory named "UCI HAR Dataset", containing the original hiarchy ("test", "train", ...).
for example, this file path should exist: "[your working directory]/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt"
