# Code Book
of the data created from the run_analysis.R scipt

All variable names are taken from the original dataset "UCI HAR Dataset".

The variable names for all the measurements come from the "features.txt" file and are described in the "features_info.txt" file.

"activity" was taken from the "y_train.txt" and "y_test.txt" files, and made descriptive with the "activity_labels.txt" file.

"subject" was taken from the "subject_train.txt" and "subject_test.txt" files

The measurements variables have the same names as the original ones, but they are actually the average of each measurement, for each subject and activity type.
